### 3.1 Installation
<a id="installation"></a>

TO BE CHANGED

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed on your Computer.

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your AddressBook.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar addressbook.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * `list` : Lists all contacts.
    * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
    * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

<a id="editing-the-data-file"></a>

AddressBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>
<b>Caution:</b>
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, the TrackMate application will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the TrackMate to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## 5. FAQ
<a id="faq"></a>

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous EduLink-NUS home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6 Known issues
<a id="known-issues"></a>

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **`NAME` Parameter**, if you try to enter a name that contains `/` the application will show error message about invalid format for `NAME` but someone can have `/` in their legal name e.g `Prabhat S/O Radhe`, this limitation arises due to usage of `/` character for Internal use within the Application. The remedy is to use `|` i.e. pipe character in place of `/`. We Understand that this format doesn't comply with their Legal Names but Since Our Application identifies students based on their StudentID , this remedy doesn't limit the Capabilities of EduLink-NUS in any possible way.
3. **Student List Panel doesn't move**, if you click `UP` or `DOWN` arrow key to view Student Details Card for students even though the details card are shown correctly and changes perfectly according to the input , the Student List Panel doesn't scroll down or up to align or match with the current Student Displayed in the Details Card. The remedy is to scroll down manually to the highlighted Student Card in the Panel to know which student which being currently displayed.
